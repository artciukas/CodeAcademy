"""
Magic Number problem. A number is said to be a magic number, 
if the sum of its digits are calculated till a single digit recursively 
by adding the sum of the digits after every addition. 
If the single digit comes out to be 1,then the number is a magic number.

For example: Number = 50113 => 5+0+1+1+3=10 => 1+0=1 This is a Magic Number
For example: Number = 1234 => 1+2+3+4=10 => 1+0=1 This is a Magic Number

Write a python function that takes in one parameter - integer 
and then returns True if number is magic number or False if it is not a magic number
